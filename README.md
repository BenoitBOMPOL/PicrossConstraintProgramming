# Solving Picross using Constraint-Programming tools

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PICROSS-DONE-chartreuse.svg)](https://shields.io/)
- Creation of a _generic_ picross instance
- For each constraint (tuple, size), enumeration of every solution works
- Creation of a picross-solver class

- 😮‍💨 : Solver is using reification (solver.ifThen)
  - (Version ![1.0](https://github.com/BenoitBOMPOL/PicrossConstraintProgramming/releases/tag/v1.0) is using reification)
  
- ⚔️ : Solver does not work for middle-size Picross (10x10 Picross grids appear to be the limit)

- 🧮 : Replacing refication by inequalities (can be done using boolean/MIP-like constraints 🤢)

- ✍️ : Writing a small report
